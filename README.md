# PokeCatcher-SimpleInstall
AutoCatcher and helper for Pokecord !!

# Setting Up

- You will only require the token of the account you want to run this bot on, it's better if it's an alt as selfbots violate ToS and you can get banned. To grab your token visit [this page](https://github.com/TheRacingLion/Discord-SelfBot/wiki/Discord-Token-Tutorial).
- For further configuration you'll need to start the bot and access localhost:3000

# This doesn't work ?

No, the source code here isn't working, as I edited it to do so, you can still read it if you want to make sure it contains no virus or malware.
I won't stole your token, I'm just a student who needs money to continue his project.
The bot will still be updated and have new features.
